# 📊 Data Analysis Journey

Welcome to my code repository! This repository serves as a portfolio of my daily practice, learning progress, and projects as I build my skills in Data Analysis.

## 🚀 Goal
The goal of this repository is to document my consistency in coding and to showcase my ability to handle data using Python's core libraries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Topics
I regularly commit code related to:

* **Python:** Core concepts, functions, and loops.
* **NumPy:** Array manipulation, mathematical operations, and linear algebra.
* **Pandas:** Data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and handling missing values.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** Data visualization and plotting.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `01_Numpy/` - Mathematical computing exercises.
* `02_Pandas/` - Data manipulation and analysis scripts.
* `03_Matplotlib/` - Visualization graphs and charts.
* `Projects/` - Mini-projects combining all skills.

## 📫 Connect with Me
I am actively seeking opportunities in Data Analysis.
