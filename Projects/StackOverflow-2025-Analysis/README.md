# 📊 State of the Developer Ecosystem 2025

### Project Overview
This project analyzes the **2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey** to understand the impact of AI Agents on the software industry. As a Data Analyst, I explored how AI orchestration tools are reshaping developer workflows, salary expectations, and skill requirements in India and globally.

### 🎯 Key Business Questions
1. **The AI Shift:** What percentage of developers are transitioning from standard coding assistants to AI Agents?
2. **Salary Determinants:** How does Cloud & AI proficiency impact fresher salaries in 2025?
3. **The Human Element:** In what scenarios do developers still prefer human support over AI?

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Data cleaning and manipulation.
* **Pandas:** Complex filtering, grouping, and handling missing values (NaN).
* **Matplotlib:** Data visualization (Bar charts, Pie charts, Subplots).

### 📂 File Structure
