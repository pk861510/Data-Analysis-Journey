# 🍽️ Restaurant Market Analysis: Global EDA

### 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a global restaurant dataset. As a Data Analyst, I explored the factors that drive restaurant success, focusing on pricing strategies, service offerings (delivery/booking), and cuisine trends to provide actionable insights for food-tech platforms.

### 🎯 Key Business Questions
1. **Market Presence:** Which geographical locations show the highest density of restaurant operations?
2. **Service Impact:** Do value-added services like **Online Delivery** and **Table Booking** significantly correlate with higher customer ratings?
3. **Cuisine Strategy:** Which cuisines dominate the market, and does menu variety lead to better customer engagement?
4. **Price Elasticity:** How is the "Average Cost for Two" distributed, and how does it relate to the overall rating?

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Core logic and data processing.
* **Pandas:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and complex aggregations.
* **Matplotlib:** Creating professional visualizations (Histograms, Box plots, and Bar charts) to communicate trends.

### 📂 File Structure
* **`Data/`**: Raw dataset files.
* **`python_scripts/`**: Jupyter notebooks containing the step-by-step cleaning and analysis.
* **`outputPlots/`**: Exported visualizations used for the final business report.

### 📊 Top Insights
* **Service Premium:** Restaurants offering both online delivery and table booking maintain a **20% higher average rating** than those without.
* **Pricing:** Most successful restaurants are positioned in the "Affordable" price bracket, showing a right-skewed distribution in cost.
* **Volume vs. Quality:** A strong positive correlation exists between the number of votes and the final rating, suggesting that popular restaurants successfully maintain quality at scale.
